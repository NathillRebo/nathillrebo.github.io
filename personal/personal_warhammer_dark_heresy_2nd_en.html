  <p>Warhammer Dark Heresy is a role-playing game in which one player takes the role of the Game Master and tells the story, while the rest of the players take the roles of characters they have previously created and make decisions. It is one of several RPG systems in the Warhammer 40,000 universeâ€”a dark and brutal world where danger lurks around every corner.
  <p>The database below is a collection of tables from the game, such as advance costs, character names, character creation options, items, psionic powers, malignancies, and mutations. These lists are expanded with respective tables from similar systems, such as Rogue Trader and Deathwatch, and expanded with my own ideas.
  <p>Along with the spreadsheet below, I have also written a program that opens the spreadsheet and allows you to, among other things, randomly select items.</p>
